# Process
1. **Collecting Data**  
   - Gather image data from various sources (e.g., medical imaging datasets)

2. **Data Pre-Processing**  
   - Clean and standardize the data
   - Normalize image dimensions
   - Convert images to grayscale (if needed)

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze label distribution
   - Explore class frequency
   - Understand feature relationships

4. **Data Balancing**  
   - Handle class imbalance using:
     - Oversampling
     - Undersampling
     - SMOTE

5. **Image Processing**  
   - Apply filters for noise reduction
   - Perform contrast enhancement (e.g., histogram equalization)
   - Focus on Region of Interest (ROI)

6. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Extract features such as:
     - Texture descriptors (e.g., Haralick, LBP)
     - Intensity histograms
     - Shape-based features

7. **Data Splitting**  
   - Split the dataset into:
     - **Training set**: 70%
     - **Testing set**: 30%

8. **Training (70%)**  
   - Train machine learning models:
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     - Others (optional)

9. **Classification**  
   - Classify images based on trained model
   - Predict categories (e.g., benign vs. malignant)

10. **Evaluation**  
    - Evaluate model performance using:
      - Accuracy
      - Precision, Recall, F1-score
      - Confusion Matrix

11. **Detection**  
    - Use the model for real-world detection tasks
